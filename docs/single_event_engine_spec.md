# Single Event Engine Specification

## Purpose

The first version of the Taiwan Geopolitical Risk Event Study Engine should process one event from start to finish.

The goal is not scalability.

The goal is to prove that the workflow can be executed automatically.

* event_name
* event_date
* asset
* benchmark
* event window

---

Step 2

Load required market data.

Example:

* TSMC
* SOX

Outputs:

aligned price dataset

---

Step 3

Calculate daily returns.

Outputs:

daily return series

---

Step 4

Calculate abnormal returns.

Outputs:

abnormal return series

---

Step 5

Calculate CAR.

Outputs:

event-level CAR metric

---

Step 6

Save results.

Outputs:

results/event_results.csv

---

Step 7

Generate figure.

Outputs:

figures/pelosi_visit_event_chart.png

---

Step 8

Generate report.

## Success Criteria

The engine should be able to process one event and automatically produce:

1. Event-level CAR
2. Results table
3. Figure
4. Report

without manual calculation.

## Non-Goals

Version 1 does not need:

* multiple events
* AI classification
* agent behavior
* automated event discovery

These features belong to future phases.
