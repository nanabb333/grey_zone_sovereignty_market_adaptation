# Taiwan Geopolitical Risk Event Study Engine

## One-Sentence Description

An automated analytics engine that measures financial market responses to Taiwan-related geopolitical events using event-study methodology.

## Business Problem

Geopolitical events can affect financial markets quickly, but manual event-study analysis is slow, difficult to repeat, and vulnerable to inconsistent workflow decisions.

Political risk analysts, financial research teams, and business analytics stakeholders need a repeatable workflow that can convert event metadata, market data, and event-window assumptions into structured outputs for review.

## Analytics Solution

This project transforms a manual Taiwan geopolitical-risk event study into an automated analytics engine.

The engine reads standardized event inputs, loads market data, calculates returns, calculates benchmark-adjusted abnormal returns, calculates cumulative abnormal return (CAR), and generates reusable CSV, figure, and Markdown report outputs.

Repo 2 is designed as an analytics product, not a research paper.

## Current Status

V2 multi-event batch processing is implemented.

The engine currently:

- reads multiple events from `events/events.csv`
- processes each event in a batch loop
- preserves a clear `process_one_event(event)` boundary
- records success or failure for each event
- continues processing after event-level failures
- writes a run summary after each batch execution

## Workflow

```text
events/events.csv
↓
Load all events
↓
FOR EACH EVENT
    Load market data
    Calculate returns
    Calculate abnormal returns
    Calculate CAR
    Save event-window data
    Generate figure
    Generate report
    Record event status
↓
Write master results table
↓
Write mechanism summary
↓
Write run summary
```

## Current Input Files

| Input | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Event input | `events/events.csv` | Defines events, assets, benchmarks, and event windows |
| Market data | `data/market_data.csv` | Standardized market price data used by the engine |

Current event schema:

```csv
event_id,event_name,event_date,mechanism,event_type,asset,benchmark,event_window_start,event_window_end
```

## Current Outputs

| Output | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Master event results | `results/event_results.csv` | One row per processed event |
| Mechanism summary | `results/mechanism_summary.csv` | Portfolio-level CAR summary by mechanism |
| Event-window data | `results/event_windows/{event_id}_event_window_data.csv` | Daily event-window returns and abnormal returns |
| Event figures | `figures/{event_id}_abnormal_returns.png` | Per-event abnormal return figure |
| Event reports | `reports/{event_id}_report.md` | Per-event analyst-facing Markdown report |
| Run summary | `results/run_summary.md` | Batch-level status summary |

The old V1 file `results/event_window_data.csv` is deprecated. V2 active event-window outputs are stored in `results/event_windows/`.

## Example Output Figure

## Example Report

The engine automatically generates one Markdown report per successful event.

Example:

[reports/E001_report.md](reports/E001_report.md)

## How to Run V2

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the batch engine:

```bash
MPLCONFIGDIR=/private/tmp/matplotlib-cache /Users/cjy/miniconda3/bin/python3 scripts/run_event_study.py
```

The `MPLCONFIGDIR` setting gives Matplotlib a writable cache location on this machine.

## Current Metric Definition

`car_value` is benchmark-adjusted abnormal CAR under the current engine definition.

The engine calculates:

```text
asset_return = asset daily percentage change
benchmark_return = benchmark daily percentage change
abnormal_return = asset_return - benchmark_return
car_value = sum of abnormal_return inside the event window
```

For the current TSMC examples, the benchmark is SOX.

Raw CAR is not yet implemented as a separate output field. It is planned as a future enhancement.

## Event-Level Failure Handling

The engine records a status for each event in `results/event_results.csv`.

Current status behavior:

- `success`: the event processed successfully
- `failed`: the event failed, but the batch continued

Failed events are recorded with an `error_message` so the analyst can diagnose the problem without losing outputs for other events.

## Portfolio Analytics Layer

The engine also generates:

```text
results/mechanism_summary.csv
```

This file summarizes `car_value` by mechanism using successful events for CAR statistics and counting failed events separately.

Current mechanism summary fields:

```text
mechanism
event_count
mean_car_value
min_car_value
max_car_value
successful_event_count
failed_event_count
```

## Connection to Repo 1

Repo 1 was the manual research project:

**Grey-Zone Sovereignty and Market Adaptation: Financial Responses to Taiwan-Related Geopolitical Shocks**

Repo 1 developed the event classifications, market data workflow, abnormal-return calculations, CAR outputs, figures, and research interpretation.

Repo 2 turns that manual event-study workflow into an automated analytics engine.

```text
Repo 1 = research method and evidence trail
Repo 2 = repeatable analytics engine
```

## Roadmap

- Raw CAR + abnormal CAR outputs
- Richer validation fields
- Batch report index
- Dashboard development
- AI-assisted event classification
- Agent-assisted analyst review
